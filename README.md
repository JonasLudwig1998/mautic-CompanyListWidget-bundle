# Plugin: Company List Widget by Leuchtfeuer
Add Widget that lists Companies (filtered by segment and/or tag) in the Dashboard

By default, the companies in the widget will be updated automatically every 10 minutes. 
The time after which the widget will be updated can be adjusted under Settings->Configuration->System Settings->System Defaults->Cached data timeout. 
Keep in mind that adjusting this setting also affects other functionalities that rely on the 'Cached data timeout'.
